Inside this document its presented some nomenclature rules.

Every restriction follows this form:

-Constraint restrictionName Restriction type reference

Certain restriction types used are:
1) NOT NULL - this column canÂ´t have null values
2) UNIQUE - every element on that column is unique, not repeated 
3) PRIMARY KEY - defines as the primary key, either simple or composed.
4) FOREIGN KEY - defines as the foreign key, either simple or composed.
4) REFERENCES- defines from which table a certain column is referred.

Names given for the restrictions:
2) un_ for UNIQUE fields
3) pk_ for PRIMARY KEY
4) fk_ for FOREIGN KEY

Creating tables:
	CREATE TABLE student (
studentId int,
name varchar(255);
age int,
CONSTRAINT pk_student PRIMARY KEY (studentId)
);

In this example, we are creating a table of students, that has studentId, name, age as columns. studentId is then defined as the primary key.
This primary key is simple.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CREATE TABLE student (
studentId int,
school_year int,
class double CONSTRAINT un_Class UNIQUE,
name varchar(255);
age int not null,
CONSTRAINT pk_student PRIMARY KEY (studentId, school_year)
);

In this example, we are creating a table of students, that has studentId,school_year, name, age as columns. studentId grouped with school_year is then defined as the primary key.
This primary key is composed.

NOTES:
	- When attributed to a column the PRIMARY KEY, that column is assumed as UNIQUE and NOT NULL
	- When naming a column with more then 1 word, we space them with an underscore (school_year)
	- When defining a column unique, it is used CONSTRAINT un_NameofColumn (un_ is the key identifier)
	- When defining a column not null, it is used not null after the definition of the column
